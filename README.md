# Welcome!

As you work your way through the lessons here, you'll see that some lessons are meant just to be read through. We call this type of a lesson a **Readme**. Readmes are files usually found in code respositories that contain info a coder needs to know about the project at hand. Our Readme lessons are full of concepts, key terms and resourcesâ€”and animated gifs, of course. Once you've finished taking in the information in the Readme, you can mark the lesson as complete by clicking on the blue button labeled "I'm Done" over on the righthand side of the page. Then you'll be able to move on to the next lesson.
